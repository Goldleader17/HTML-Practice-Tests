    <p>The number one reason traders fail is due to an absence of any risk management plus the abuse of leverage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are a professional risk manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protection of capital &gt; optimisation of profit.</p>
<p>Potential profits are seductive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Golden Rule</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Never risk more than 1% of your&nbsp;trading account per trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reverse compounding</strong>&nbsp;forces your risk to get smaller during inevitable periods of drawdown, which will fix your maximum downside, ensuring it's then&nbsp;<strong>mathematically impossible to blow&nbsp;your account.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Golden Rule eliminates the risk that is&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Drawdown</strong>&nbsp;-&gt; reduction of capital after a series of losing trades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measured by&nbsp;a relative peak in capital minus&nbsp;a relative trough in capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recovering a loss is mathematically harder than making the loss in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of your trades should end in one of four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A small win</li>
<li>A big win</li>
<li>A small loss</li>
<li>Breakeven</li>
</ol>
<p>Eliminating large losses will keep you in the game for years to come.</p>
<p>If you can't risk manage on a 'small' account, you won't be able to do it on a large account.&nbsp;</p>
