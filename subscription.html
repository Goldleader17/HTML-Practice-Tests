    <p>You have a unique financial fingerprint that is formed by patterns in your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bank accounts</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Net worth&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any one point in time, your financial fingerprint tends to bounce between a '<strong>floor'</strong> and a <strong>'ceiling'.</strong></p>
<p>You might call these levels your&nbsp;<strong>'lower financial thermostat'</strong> and your&nbsp;<strong>'upper financial thermostat'.</strong></p>
<p>These are called&nbsp;<strong>'thermostats'</strong> because as you perceive (via sensory input) that your financial situation is approaching these levels, your actions (via motor output) are automatically (often unconsciously) adjusted to keep you in <strong>'the middle'.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way of describing <strong>'the middle'</strong> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your comfort zone&nbsp;</li>
<li>Your overall financial thermostat</li>
<li>Your internal financial level</li>
<li>Your financial self-image</li>
<li>Your financial self-worth</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As your financial situation approaches or exceeds your upper financial thermostat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You start loosening up</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You become more financially sloppy</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You take greater risks</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">Your work ethic &amp; consistency declines&nbsp;</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">Your lifestyle &amp; expenses increase</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You attract people, situations &amp; circumstances to have your money&nbsp;'taken'</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You manifest unexpected bills or financial emergencies&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As your financial situation approaches or exceeds your&nbsp;lower financial thermostat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You start tightening up&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You become more financially&nbsp;calculated</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You take&nbsp;fewer risks</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">Your work ethic &amp; consistency&nbsp;increases&nbsp;</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">Your lifestyle &amp; expenses&nbsp;decrease</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You attract people, situations &amp; circumstances to&nbsp;provide new income opportunities&nbsp;</li>
<li data-pm-slice="1 1 []" data-en-clipboard="true">You manifest unexpected&nbsp;income or financial wins</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of the&nbsp;<strong>2 thermostats</strong>, your&nbsp;<strong>lower financial thermostat</strong> is by far the most significant contributor to your overall financial situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your <strong>upper financial thermostat</strong> could be likened to<strong> 'dreams'.</strong></p>
<p>Your&nbsp;<strong>lower financial thermostat</strong> could be likened to <strong>'standards'.</strong></p>
<p>You don't always achieve your dreams, but <strong>you'll always uphold your standards.</strong></p>
<p>To increase your overall financial situation,&nbsp;<strong>you must work on increasing your standards.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, these are the 6 primary components that govern your standards:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Beliefs</strong><strong> -&gt; </strong>What do you believe about money, wealth, rich people, and poor people?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Values -&gt;&nbsp;</strong>Where does wealth sit on your hierarchy of values?</li>
<li><strong>Influence -&gt;</strong> Who do you hang around most, and what is their financial situation?</li>
<li><strong>Language -&gt;&nbsp;</strong>How do you speak about money, wealth, income, finance, and affordability?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Habits -&gt;&nbsp;</strong>What are your habits around making and spending money?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Worthiness -&gt;&nbsp;</strong>At the deepest level of your being, how much money do you truly believe you deserve?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask yourself:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who do I have to become to be where I want to be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to become the person to achieve the goals that are associated with that person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are not the highest version of yourself that you can imagine/dream about, you are the lowest person which you can possibly accept and tolerate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're not you're highest dreams, you're your lowest standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can dream as high as you want, but you are not going to achieve it with your current character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How you achieve your dreams is to transcend your current self, and <strong>turn into a character who has your dreams as its standards.</strong></p>
<p>The hack designs a character who has their dreams as your standards -&gt; become that character and you achieve those dreams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Automated savings is one of the most underrated and effective wealth creation strategies.</p>
<p>Start today, do it now.</p>
<p>Put&nbsp;<strong>demand</strong> on your savings and magic shit happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Spend less than what you make</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Work on increasing your income</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>Work on sharpening your expenses</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pay yourself first</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Pay a percentage of EVERY&nbsp;Â£/â‚¬/$ you make into a savings account.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>10% of income is the bare minimum amount to start with.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>This payment is to be made&nbsp;</span><b><span><u>before</u></span></b><span>&nbsp;any payment is made to staff, family, bills, loans, mortgages, suppliers, and splurging.</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automate your savings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Your savings percentage must be automated via recurring bank transfers.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>Do NOT rely on completing this payment manually.</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Force your savings up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Every 3 months, increase the amount you're saving by 10% (or more, if you've experienced an increase in income)</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>Force it up, even if you don't know where the income will come from.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>This process increases the demand on your income and mobilises new ideas, opportunities, energy, desire, and work ethic.</span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div><span>The best part of this strategy is that it's&nbsp;</span><b><span>risk-free.</span></b><span>&nbsp;You can always draw back out of your savings account in a life or death situation (but try not to).</span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Look at your accounts daily</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>At all times, know where you're at financially.</div>
