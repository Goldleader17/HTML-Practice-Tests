<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fundamental Analysis -&gt;</strong>&nbsp;is the study of the relative economic, social, and political forces that may affect the supply and demand of one country‚Äôs currency against another. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">In the long run, the exchange rate of a currency versus other currencies is usually a direct reflection of the market‚Äôs opinion on the current and future health of its respective economy, compared to other countries' economies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">The better the shape of a country‚Äôs economy is, the more foreign businesses and investors will invest in that country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">This results in the need for those investors to purchase that country‚Äôs currency to obtain those assets, increasing the demand for that currency, and in turn then driving up the price as a result.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Fundamental traders will monitor various factors that impact the relative economic strength of countries such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">interest rates</li>
<li class="p1">unemployment numbers</li>
<li class="p1">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</li>
<li class="p1">retail sales</li>
<li class="p1">industrial production</li>
<li class="p1">inflation</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Market Mechanics</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Currency exchange rates move up and down as a result of supply and demand from market participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Every day, investors and traders, both institutional and private individuals, all buy and sell currencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">The numerous types of market participants are buying or selling for their own unique reasons, with their own unique views, ideas, and beliefs around what the currency pairs they are trading are worth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">The meeting point of buyers and sellers, for whatever reason they are acting, is price.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2">No trades can take place unless <strong>both</strong> the buyer and the seller agree on a price.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2">So this drives the price of currency pairs buyers bring with them demand for the pair, applying upward pressure on prices, while sellers bring supply, applying downward pressure on prices.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">The market runs like a continuous auction throughout the day, with buyers and sellers competing with each other to get the best possible price.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Technical Analysis -&gt;</strong>&nbsp;the framework used to identify trading opportunities through the study of price movement and volume from that battle between buyers and sellers, which is then reflected on a price chart.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><strong>Supply &amp; Demand</strong> <em>drives</em> -&gt; <strong>Orderflow</strong>&nbsp;<em>which prints&nbsp;</em>-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Price Action</strong><em> that creates&nbsp;</em>-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Patterns</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">The interaction of millions of different participants for as many reasons, all with their own emotions and agendas, forms price patterns that stretch over extended periods of time and can be used to make high probability forecasts of where price may move in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><strong>Candlesticks</strong><span>&nbsp;-&gt; visual representation of price fluctuations in the market for a set timeframe.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>Strategies can also be categorised based on duration:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>Scalping</span></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>Day Trading</span></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>Swing Trading</span></span></li>
<li class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>Position Trading</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>You can make money with any style, but your job is to discover what style of trading works best for you, your lifestyle, personality, and trading psychology.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span>The higher the duration of trading style, the more instruments, markets, and setups you may potentially want to trade (vice versa).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"><span><strong>Smart Money Concepts (SMC)</strong> -&gt; is a trading style based on a combination of analysis focused on market structure, institutional supply and demand, and liquidity concepts.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
